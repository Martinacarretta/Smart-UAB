# Smart UAB

This repository contains a collection of a notebook and code for handling sensor data, occupation data, energy consumption data, and PV production data. It also includes the training of machine learning models to create predictions based on this data.

## Features

- Dataframe handling of sensor data
- Dataframe handling of occupation data
- Dataframe handling of energy consumption data
- Dataframe handling of PV production data
- Training of machine learning models for predictions

## Website

In addition to the data handling and model training, this repository also includes the implementation of a website. The website displays live data from the sensors, predictions generated by the trained models, and warning messages.

## Website Structure

The website's structure and aesthetics are defined in the `templates` directory. This directory contains the HTML templates for the different pages that a user can navigate. 

The main code of the website is located in `app.py`. This file handles the routing and logic for serving the web pages, processing user requests, and displaying the sensor data and predictions.

The data from the sensors is stored in `data.db`, which is a SQLite database. This database is used to persist and retrieve the sensor data for display on the website.
