# Smart UAB Project

## Overview

The Smart UAB project is a comprehensive endeavor aimed at analyzing and predicting various aspects of the university's operations using data provided by the institution. The final product of this project is a website that displays live data from the sensors, predictions generated by the trained machine learning models, and warning messages.

## Data Analysis and Machine Learning

The project involves the handling and analysis of sensor data, occupation data, energy consumption data, and PV production data. These data sets are processed and analyzed using Python and various data science libraries, including pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

## Data Correlation

A significant part of the project involves the correlation analysis of energy consumption and occupation, as well as the correlation analysis of PV and temperature/weather. This analysis helps to identify patterns and relationships between different variables, which can provide valuable insights and inform decision-making.

## Models
Initially, it was attempted to create predictions using the SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model. SARIMA is a statistical model that captures various patterns in time series data, such as trends and seasonality. The results were satisfactory. 

In addition, it was of interest to explore machine learning methods. Despite their efforts, none of the models provided accurate results. Moreover, the Confidence interval were large, indicating a considerable uncertainty. This was a significant challenge for the team, as complexities of machine learning were navigated and dealed with the inherent unpredictability of the models.

The rule-based approach involved predicting energy consumption based on prior dates of the same month and weekdays. Specifically, the method calculated the average energy consumption for the same weekdays of the same month in previous years, and used this average as the prediction. This method, while simple, provided more satisfactory results than the previous methods.

After receiving recommendations, machine learning was revisited for predictions. This time, the trained models to predict energy consumption based on weekday, month, and prior occupation and energy consumption were successful. This was a significant achievement, as it demonstrated the potential of machine learning in providing accurate and useful predictions.

## Website Implementation

The website serves as the primary interface for displaying the analyzed data and predictions. It is implemented using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python. The website's structure and aesthetics are defined in the `templates` directory, which contains the HTML templates for the different pages that a user can navigate.

The main code of the website is located in `app.py`. This file handles the routing and logic for serving the web pages, processing user requests, and displaying the sensor data and predictions.

The data from the sensors is stored in a SQLite database, `data.db`. This database is used to persist and retrieve the sensor data for display on the website.

Overall, the programming languages applied are: Python, html, CCS and a little bit of java. 

## Challenges and Learning Experiences

The project presented several challenges, particularly in terms of data cohesion and website development. The team had to deal with various data types and formats, which required a significant amount of data preprocessing and cleaning.

The development of the website was another major challenge, as there was no prior experience in this area. However, through an exterior party and self-learning, a user-friendly website was created and uploaded to the Internet.

Despite these challenges, the project provided a valuable learning experience for the team. It allowed to gain hands-on experience in data analysis, machine learning, and web development, and to apply these skills in a real-world context.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the Smart UAB project is a testament to the power of data analysis and machine learning in providing valuable insights and predictions. Despite the challenges encountered, the project was a success, resulting in a functional website that serves as a valuable tool for the university.
